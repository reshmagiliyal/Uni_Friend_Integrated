# uni_friend
Application which recommends courses based on trending jobs
In this competitive era, no matter how talented one is, without proper planning,
and enough preparation, it is hard to find jobs that we desire. Uni-Friend is a solution to
that hurdle which helps the students land the desired job by suggesting the road map of
courses to be taken which will empower the students to land their dream job.
Using web scraping the data taken from various sources will be stored in a
database, which will serve as the abundant source of the resource. Uni-Friend displays
jobs based on the location choice of the user (currently implemented only in United
States). So, when a user selects a particular location, all the jobs in that area will be
displayed. Based on his/her interests, user can filter the job field using several keywords
such as Engineer, Education, Business Analyst etc.
Finding a restaurant, gas station or coffee places nearby using online apps
nowadays is a part of our daily routine. Life is easier with these applications. Uni-Friend
also helps the users find nearby places, hence the users will have all in one application.
When a user is near the university, then any place of his/or her choice which is within the
search radius, can be found by using Uni-Friend. Integration with Google Maps lets us
achieve the necessary target of finding the location of the places nearby.
Also, services that universities provide are not known to many students. Many a
times, students from other departments will not have the knowledge of services provided
by other departments. The support numbers for different services provided by SJSU are
spread across different websites and user will have to search through to get to them. To
avoid this confusion and hassle, Uni-Friend also has a page that contains all the support
numbers such as printing support, support numbers for event handling, etc.
Hence, overall, Uni-Friend is a university friendly application that is built to make
the lives of students easier and more resourceful and beneficial. It enables the students to
make the best out of what university provides.
